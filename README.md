[Humhub](https://humhub.org) CODEIT
=============

A module for administrators to edit HumHub themes online.

**Note:** The module is a work in progress, but You can use it already! **The module is working**, but we`ve not integrated all planned features right now. There is still the syntax highliting and line numbering to do. Also, the style and the responsive feature has to be improved.

You`re welcome to help us solve the issues and to make our module pervect ;)

**The Module is for HumHub Versions 0.20+**

How to install:

1. unzip the HumHub-Codeit.zip to a folder on Your pc.

###Known Problems

An error occurs when the path to the IDE is specified incorrectly.

Open **codeit/views/admin/index.php** and check if the path fit Your system settings. Maybe You have installed HumHub into a subfolder then the URL should be something like: src="/**your subfolder name**/themes/ide/index.php" Find the code at line 10.

Open **codeit/views/main/index.php** and check if the path fit Your system settings. Maybe You have installed HumHub into a subfolder then the URL should be something like: src="/**your subfolder name**/themes/ide/index.php" Find the code at line 12.

**Note:** I personaly run into a little problem after I tried to uninstall the module. I know no solution so far and would be happy if you give me some adwise how to solv that problem. Thank You!
